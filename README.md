This Bot was made by me and is one, if not the only one, which is currently public available and working.
I made this Bot after working on a JavaScript Version (Electron App) which had it's difficulties while and after. Know, after a Year of development, lots of trial and error and 0 banned Accounts, I will publish this Bot for free

## Translation

To contribute a translation do the following:
1. Clone the latest version of the repository
2. Check if you language is already added
3. If not, **duplicate** those two files: [strings.en.resx](https://github.com/Th3C0D3R/FoBCS/blob/master/ForgeOfBots/strings.en.resx) and [strings.en.Designer.cs](https://github.com/Th3C0D3R/FoBCS/blob/master/ForgeOfBots/strings.en.Designer.cs) and rename the duplicates to the coressponding language code, eg: ***strings.fr.resx*** and ***strings.fr.Designer.cs*** and edit the strings (Visual Sutdio recomended)
4. Add the language inside this file [languages.json](https://github.com/Th3C0D3R/FoBCS/blob/master/ForgeOfBots/languages.json) and use the next number for the *index*-field. For the *language*-field use the name of your language (for example: *German* is *Deutsch*, *English* is *English*,*French* is *Fran√ßais*)
5. Create a Pull-Request as soon as your done and wait for response
6. The new Language will be added to the Bot dynamically and does not need a new version update
